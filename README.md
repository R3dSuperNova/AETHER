# AETHER ⚡ Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness

AETHER is a next-generation defense system that fuses **real-time RF diagnostics** with **emotional state sensing** to optimize situational awareness, reduce mission risk, and support operator resilience. Designed for high-stakes field conditions, AETHER adapts interface feedback, records pulse data, and tracks fatigue or stress signals to alert support systems or adjust operator workflow.

## 🔍 Core Features

- 🧠 **Emotional Telemetry Engine** – Captures real-time data from physiological or behavioral inputs  
- 📶 **RF Diagnostics Layer** – Interfaces with test systems to measure electromagnetic health  
- 🎯 **Fatigue-Adaptive UI** – Dynamically adjusts based on operator stress or attention shifts  
- 📡 **Real-Time Data Logging** – Behavioral and performance metrics are continuously tracked  
- 💡 **Failsafe Feedback System** – Alerts operators or connected systems when anomalies or distress signals are detected

## 🧪 Proof of Concept

AETHER has been validated through CLI-based simulation runs with varying emotional parameter loads:

| Load Factor | Status |
|------------|--------|
| 0.2 | ✅ Pass |
| 0.5 | ✅ Pass |
| 0.7 | ✅ Pass |
| 0.85 | ✅ Pass |
| 0.95 | ✅ Pass |

Visual outputs and simulation captures are available in the [`/aether-core/media`](./aether-core/media) directory.

## 💡 Why AETHER Matters

Operators face more than just system failures. Fatigue, emotional overload, and attention lapses can cause catastrophic outcomes in defense and aerospace environments. AETHER is designed to detect these signals early—before failure happens—serving as a digital sixth sense for human-machine harmony.
