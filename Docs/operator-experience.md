# ðŸ§  Operator Experience & Safety

AETHER dynamically adjusts the operator interface in real-time based on emotional and cognitive telemetry. This file outlines how human factors data translates into UI/UX adaptations, ensuring both user safety and mission reliability.

---

## 1. Monitoring Inputs

- Heart rate variability (HRV)
- EEG stress patterns (alpha suppression, theta spikes)
- Microexpression detection (blinking rate, brow tension)
- Typing cadence / reaction time slowdown

---

## 2. Adaptive UI Behaviors

| Detected Signal | UI Response |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Elevated HRV + slowed reaction | Simplified instructions, reduced on-screen clutter |
| Microexpression: frustration | Voice-guided prompts enabled, task de-escalation triggered |
| Eye fatigue from IR exposure | Color palette dims, font size increases |
| Cognitive overload patterns | Task segmentation with progress checkpoints |

---

## 3. Safety Interrupt Triggers

If critical stress thresholds are reached:

- **Pause diagnostic workflow** with a warning prompt
- **Log incident** for supervisor review
- **Offer grounding mode**: voice assistant, color gradient loop, or focus timer

---

## 4. Long-Term UX Personalization

AETHER learns operator-specific fatigue profiles and tailors:

- Visual pacing
- Test complexity thresholds
- Input timing flexibility

This ensures every operatorâ€™s cognitive rhythm is respected and safeguarded.

### ðŸŽ¯ Outcome

By aligning interface behavior with real-time stress indicators, AETHER minimizes mission risk and honors the emotional toll of frontline diagnostics.
