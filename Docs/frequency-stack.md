# 📡 Frequency Stack  
_A layered model for interpreting human & environmental signals alongside automated radio-test output_

---

## 1 · Purpose

Automated Radio-Test Equipment (ARTE) excels at detecting **technical** anomalies.  
**AETHER** expands that capability by interpreting **human-state** and **environmental-context** signals in parallel.  
The **Frequency Stack** is our guide: a five-layer framework that filters raw telemetry into actionable insights.

## 2 · Why It Matters for ARTE

| Challenge in Field Testing                 | Frequency Stack Solution                           |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Operator fatigue causes false failures    | Adds Emotional & Cognitive layers to flag stress   |
| High ambient noise masks RF irregularities| Correlates Environmental layer with System output |
| UI overload in noisy combat zones         | Adaptive UX responds to Cognitive load cues        |

By aligning ARTE’s native **System Layer** logs with higher-order frequency layers, AETHER distinguishes **equipment faults** from **operator-induced variance**—preventing unnecessary retests, mission delays, or equipment misuse.

## 3 · The Five Layers

| # | Layer Name        | Description                                                | Example Data Sources                                       |
|---|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Physiological** | Raw biometric input                                        | HRV, GSR, respiration                                      |
| 2 | **Cognitive**     | Attention, workload, decision latency                      | UI-interaction timing, task-switch rate                    |
| 3 | **Emotional**     | Stress, frustration, confidence                            | Voice tone, micro-expressions, sentiment analysis          |
| 4 | **Environmental** | External conditions influencing test reliability           | Ambient noise (dB), light, vibration, temperature          |
| 5 | **System**        | ARTE hardware/software diagnostics & signal integrity      | RSSI, BER, test retries, packet loss, latency              |

## 5 · ARTE Integration Path

1. **Tap Native Logs** – Ingest JSON or CSV exports from ARTE (System Layer).  
2. **Timestamp Merge** – Align biometric & environmental sensors by synchronized UTC.  
3. **Layer Parsing** – Map each datapoint to its Frequency Stack layer.  
4. **Correlation Engine** – Identify cross-layer anomalies (e.g., System fault + Emotional spike).  
5. **Decision Bus** – Trigger UI adjustments or retest flags when multi-layer risk detected.

---

## 6 · Use-Case Examples

- **False Fail Filter**:  
  *System reports out-of-spec RSSI, but Environmental layer shows 95 dB background noise → retest automatically scheduled instead of immediate fail.*

- **Operator-Safety Pause**:  
  *System passes all technical checks; Emotional layer flags high stress & Cognitive layer shows decision lag → AETHER dims UI, inserts guided micro-break.*

## 7 · Next Steps

1. **Generate final PNG diagram** (`frequency_stack_diagram.png`) for `/media`.  
2. **Prototype timestamp merger script** to sync ARTE logs with wearable data.  
3. **Develop correlation rules** in `frequency_stack_engine.py`.  
4. **Field-validate** with live ARTE hardware + biometric patch kit.
