# Vision – Project AETHER

Project AETHER aims to revolutionize defense equipment testing by integrating adaptive AI, emotional intelligence, and predictive diagnostics. The mission is to elevate Astronics Test Systems to an industry leader in smart, human-aware test solutions.

We build not only for the machines — but for the people who rely on them under fire.
