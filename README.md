# 🛰️ Project AETHER

## 🔹 AI-Enhanced Test System for Defense & Operator Wellbeing

---

## 🎯 Mission

**AETHER** (Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness) is a next-generation test interface for defense equipment — integrating real-time **signal validation** and **emotional state monitoring** for field operators.

> ⚠️ In battlefield conditions, human fatigue is as critical as hardware failure. AETHER safeguards against both.

## 🧰 What It Does

- Validates radio and avionics equipment using existing RF diagnostics  
- Monitors cognitive/emotional load via biosignal interpretation  
- Adapts UI and test complexity based on operator fatigue levels  
- Prevents critical errors during mission testing or signal deployment  
- Logs de-identified behavioral data for long-term Human Factors R&D

## 🔧 Core System Components

| Module            | Function                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `signal-engine`   | Processes RF diagnostics and detects anomalies                           |
| `fault-prediction`| Forecasts system failures before they occur                              |
| `state-tracker`   | Assesses emotional/cognitive fatigue in operators                        |
| `ui-adapter`      | Adjusts visual/interactive UX based on emotional telemetry               |
