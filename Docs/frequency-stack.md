# Frequency Stack: Interpreting Signal through Human Context

## 1. Overview

The Frequency Stack is AETHER's conceptual model for understanding signal input beyond raw data. It categorizes real-time telemetry across human and environmental dimensions, enabling deeper interpretation of stress patterns, operator intent, and diagnostic anomalies.

## 2. Purpose

This model helps AETHER distinguish between:

- **True system faults** vs **operator-induced variance**
- **High-alert responses** vs **fatigue-based input lag**
- **Anomalies** vs **expected behavioral conditions**

Understanding this layered input is critical for test reliability, especially in mission-critical military environments.

## 3. Stack Architecture

The Frequency Stack is divided into five core layers:

| Layer | Description | Example Signals |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1. **Physiological Layer** | Real-time vitals and neuro-feedback | HRV, cortisol proxies, galvanic skin response |
| 2. **Cognitive Layer** | Focus level, memory strain, task-switching effort | Eye-tracking, blink rate, voice stress |
| 3. **Emotional Layer** | Stress, frustration, fatigue, confidence | Sentiment from tone, posture shifts |
| 4. **Environmental Layer** | Noise, light, temperature, mission chaos | Sensor inputs, ambient decibel levels |
| 5. **System Layer** | Hardware/software responsiveness | Lag, dropped packets, system interrupts |

## 5. Application in AETHER

In field use, the Frequency Stack enables adaptive diagnostics:

- **Example 1:** If a failed test result coincides with operator frustration and rising environmental noise, the system can flag the result for retest before escalation.
- **Example 2:** A consistent pattern of elevated emotional frequency paired with clean system output may prompt a UI simplification overlay to reduce stress.

## 6. Future Considerations

The Frequency Stack may evolve into a machine-learning model trained on labeled operator behavior patterns, increasing precision over time.
