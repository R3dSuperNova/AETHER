# AETHER Signal Engine Specification

## 1. Overview

The AETHER Signal Engine is the core analytic subsystem that interprets signal test data and adapts dynamically to both technical anomalies and operator behavioral inputs. Designed for defense-grade radio frequency (RF) test systems, AETHER brings together AI-driven signal analysis with operator-aware interfacing to improve test fidelity and reduce false negatives/positives in the field.

## 2. Input Streams

### 2.1 Signal Data Inputs
- RF Signal Frequencies (VHF/UHF/SATCOM)
- Modulation Formats (AM, FM, PSK, QAM)
- Harmonic Distortion Measurements
- Frequency Drift
- Power Output Consistency
- Impulse Response

### 2.2 Operator Behavior (Inferred)
- Input device interaction metrics (mouse lag, hesitance, retry frequency)
- Audio cues (optional future integration)
- Biometric proxies (if available): HRV, skin conductance (through API or wearable)

## 3. Signal Processing Pipeline

### 3.1 Preprocessing
- Signal normalization and noise filtering
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency-domain analysis
- Temporal alignment for pulse or burst pattern analysis

### 3.2 Feature Extraction
- Peak signal detection
- Frequency band correlation
- SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) scoring
- Dynamic range and jitter profiling

### 3.3 Model Inference
- **Baseline Models**: Decision Trees for fast fail/pass classification
- **Advanced Models**: CNN/Transformer architectures for waveform classification and anomaly detection
- Confidence scoring: probability-based evaluation with thresholds

## 4. Operator-Aware Adaptive Layer

- Detect operator stress or fatigue based on:
  - Interaction timing anomalies (high jitter or frequent command reversal)
  - Session duration without breaks
- Modify interface dynamically:
  - Reduce visual stimulus intensity under stress
  - Display actionable recommendations with minimal distractions
  - Log cognitive load profile for after-action review (AAR)

## 5. Output Protocols

- **Test Verdict**: Pass / Fail / Warning
- **Confidence Score**: 0–100%
- **Flag Types**:
  - Signal Deviation
  - Operator Anomaly
  - Inconclusive — Re-Test Advised
- **Logging**:
  - Timestamped result bundle (JSON)
  - Operator behavior record (optional CSV/JSON)
  - AI decision trace log

## 6. Constraints and Considerations

### Technically Feasible (Confirmed)
- Real-time FFT + ML classification is viable using embedded GPUs or edge processors
- Inference from interaction patterns is viable without biometric data
- Operator interface adjustments can be parameterized and toggled in real-time

### Future Enhancements (Dependent on Hardware)
- Biometric integration (wearables)
- Voice stress analysis (requires custom datasets)
- Field mesh integration via satellite sync (in development)

## 7. Dependencies and Environment

- Python 3.10+
- NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Optional: OpenCV for waveform capture
- Hardware: NVIDIA Jetson or x86 embedded system with GPU support

## 8. Version Control

- `signal-engine.py` to house logic core
- `signal-engine-config.yaml` for tunable parameters
- `signal-engine-testcases.json` to simulate signal edge conditions
