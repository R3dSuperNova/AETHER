# 🌩️ AETHER Emotional Simulation – Proof of Concept

This folder contains the working logic and output artifacts for **AETHER’s core emotional stress response engine**, designed to detect, simulate, and respond to operator stress inputs in real time.

---

## 🎯 Simulation Script

The script `emotion_logic_sim.py` allows simulation of stress levels from `'0.0'` to `'1.0'`, triggering adaptive system behaviors based on emotional telemetry input.

| Stress Input | System Behavior                              |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `0.2`        | Baseline – Full diagnostics enabled           |
| `0.5`        | Moderate – UI simplification triggered        |
| `0.7`        | High – Micro-break protocol triggered         |
| `0.85`       | Elevated – Pre-critical risk response         |
| `0.95`       | Critical – Testing halted for operator safety |

## 🧠 System Logic Diagram

![AETHER Emotional Signal Flow](../media/AETHER_logic_flow_diagram.png)

This diagram visualizes the core signal path:

1. **Stress Input** →  
2. **Logic Engine** processes emotional telemetry →  
3. **UI Behavior** is conditionally triggered →  
4. **Response is Logged** for review or escalation  

This pipeline enables **human-aware test system behavior** with immediate adjustments based on input levels.

|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `POC - Simulation - 0.2.png` | System baseline – all clear                  |
| `POC - Simulation - 0.5.png` | Moderate stress detected                     |
| `POC - Simulation - 0.7.png` | High stress – auto-break engaged             |
| `POC - Simulation - 0.85.png`| Elevated stress – pre-critical response      |
| `POC - Simulation - 0.95.png`| Critical state – simulation halted           |
