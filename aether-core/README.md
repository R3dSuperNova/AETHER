# 🧠 AETHER Emotional Simulation – Proof of Concept

This folder contains the working logic and outputs for AETHER's core emotional stress response system.

---

## 🔬 Simulation Script

The file `emotion_logic_sim.py` allows us to simulate stress levels from `0.0` to `1.0` and outputs corresponding system behavior.

| Stress Input | System Behavior |
|--------------|------------------|
| 0.2          | Baseline – Full diagnostics enabled |
| 0.5          | Moderate – UI simplification triggered |
| 0.7          | High – Micro-break protocol triggered |
| 0.85         | Elevated – Pre-critical risk response |
| 0.95         | Critical – Testing halted for operator safety |

## 🖼️ Screenshot Outputs

Each PNG in this folder shows real terminal output from the simulation.

| Screenshot File                     | Meaning                          |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `POC - Similation - 0.2.png`       | System baseline – all clear      |
| `POC - Similation - 0.5.png`       | Moderate stress detected         |
| `POC - Similation - 0.7.png`       | High stress – auto-break engaged |
| `POC - Similation - 0.85.png`      | Elevated risk                    |
| `POC - Similation - 0.95.png`      | Critical state – testing paused  |

## 🎯 Summary

These results demonstrate a **functioning logic layer** within AETHER, where **emotional telemetry input drives adaptive system behavior**. This is a critical step toward the larger vision: safeguarding both human and hardware integrity in defense-grade RF testing environments.
