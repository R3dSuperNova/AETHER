# AETHER UI Narrative â€“ Emotionally Intelligent Defense Testing

## 1. Human-Centric Login
The interface begins by assessing the emotional baseline of the operator. Using biometric input (facial strain, heart rate, grip pressure), AETHER subtly adjusts interface toneâ€”ensuring cognitive readiness before testing begins.

## 2. Emotion-Sync Dashboard
Visual stress indicators adjust color gradients across the UI. A cool tone signals regulated stress. A warm tone signals cognitive overload. The operator sees their emotional telemetry in tandem with RF system feedbackâ€”creating trust between user and machine.

## 3. Fatigue-Adaptive Testing Panel
As the system detects fatigue, AETHER:
- Enlarges critical buttons
- Minimizes information overload
- Switches to tactile-friendly interface for field use
This ensures operator focus without overburdening decision-making capacity.

## 4. Alert & Regulation Triggers
If the system detects high emotional strain:
- A guided micro-break is triggered
- UI tone softens
- RF testing pauses until safe resumption
This keeps the human system safeâ€”just like the hardware it tests.

## 5. Operational Integrity Overlay
All telemetry data is logged alongside emotional state. Over time, this creates a bio-performance log that enhances mission safety and AI co-regulation.

This is not just a test systemâ€”it's a co-regulator.
