# ⚔️ AETHER
## Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness  
*AI-Enhanced Test System for Defense & Operator Well-Being*

---

### 🚀 Executive Snapshot
> **AETHER is the first RF diagnostic platform that adapts—to the machine *and* the human.**  
> In battlefield and depot conditions alike, technician fatigue is as fatal as hardware failure.  
> **AETHER safeguards both.**

---

## 🎯 Mission
AETHER merges **real-time signal validation** with **emotional-state monitoring** for field operators.  
It predicts faults, prevents operator error, and protects mission integrity.

---

## 💡 Why AETHER?

Traditional test benches treat technicians as flawless cogs; reality proves otherwise.  
AETHER closes that gap by fusing **RF precision** with **biometric empathy**:

| Pain Point (Today) | AETHER Advantage |
|--------------------|------------------|
| High-stress, 14-hour shifts | Emotion-adaptive UI de-escalates overload |
| Hidden fatigue errors | Fatigue spikes auto-pause high-risk procedures |
| Siloed data sets | Unified log of RF metrics **+** biometric patterns |
| Reactive maintenance | Predictive fault engine stops failures **before** they surface |

---

## 🔬 What It Does

- **Validates** radio & avionics equipment using battle-tested RF diagnostics  
- **Monitors** cognitive / emotional load via biometric interpretation  
- **Adapts** UI & test complexity as operator fatigue rises  
- **Prevents** critical errors during mission setup & signal deployment  
- **Logs** de-identified behavioral data for long-term Human-Factors R&D

## 🧠 Emotional UI in Action

[📖 Full UX Narrative → `ui-sketches/ui-story.md`](./ui-sketches/ui-story.md)

| Trigger | AETHER Real-Time Response |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Fatigue spike** | Interface collapses to critical controls only |
| **Stress surge** | Color temperature cools; guided micro-break prompt |
| **Loss of focus** | Contextual automation takes over repetitive tasks |
| **Calm baseline** | Restores full diagnostic dashboard |
