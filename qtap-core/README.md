# QTAP: Quantum-Tuned Adaptive Protocol  
*A Real-Time Emotional & Physiological Monitoring Engine*

---

## 🔍 What is QTAP?

QTAP (Quantum-Tuned Adaptive Protocol) is the emotional intelligence core of **Project AETHER**—a lightweight yet powerful adaptive protocol that monitors the **real-time physiological and cognitive states** of frontline personnel.

QTAP doesn’t just measure.  
It **understands**, **adapts**, and **responds** to emotional thresholds—helping save lives where milliseconds matter.

## 💡 Why QTAP Exists

In defense testing, combat simulations, or high-pressure operational fields, **emotional resilience is mission-critical**.  
Yet legacy systems ignore the human behind the hardware.

QTAP was designed by and for veterans—embedding real empathy into real-time data flow.  
It’s a **guardian protocol**—scanning for invisible signs of cognitive fatigue, emotional decline, or autonomic stress signals that could put a mission—or a life—at risk.

## ⚙️ System Features

| 🔧 Feature                     | 💬 Description |
|-------------------------------|----------------|
| 🧬 **Multimodal Input Parsing** | Ingests RF signal outputs, behavioral tags, and placeholder biometric inputs (HRV, GSR, facial feedback). |
| ⌛ **Temporal Drift Monitoring** | Tracks time-based changes in operator stress and fatigue. |
| ⚠️ **Threshold Alert Triggers** | Signals to simulation environment when tolerance thresholds are exceeded. |
| 🔁 **Real-Time Feedback Loop**  | Outputs adaptive telemetry for UI overlays and simulation pacing adjustments. |

## 🧪 Proof of Concept

Simulation test values were executed across multiple drift states:

| Drift Threshold | Outcome |
|------------------|---------|
| `drift=0.2`      | ✅ Stable |
| `drift=0.5`      | ⚠️ Mild warning |
| `drift=0.7`      | ⚠️ Elevated warning |
| `drift=0.85`     | 🔴 Critical |
| `drift=0.95`     | 🛑 Simulation halted |

## 🔜 What's Next

- [ ] Connect QTAP logic directly to AETHER UI alerting layer  
- [ ] Simulate fatigue drift from real biometric datasets  
- [ ] Generate mock GSR & HRV inputs from test devices  
- [ ] Polish adaptive loop timing to respond under 250ms

## 🤝 Final Thought

QTAP brings heart to hardware.  
In an age of automated systems, it is the *first emotional telemetry layer* designed to walk beside the operator—not just observe them.

**Every threshold crossed is a chance to intervene.  
Every flag triggered is a life protected.**
