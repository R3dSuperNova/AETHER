# AETHER

**Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness**

AETHER is a next-generation diagnostic framework designed to enhance situational awareness, safety, and performance in high-stress environments. It interprets emotional and physiological signals alongside environmental and system data—bridging human state and machine diagnostics through a modular logic layer.

This system was built with a focus on real-world military and aerospace applications, where traditional diagnostic tools often miss silent or pre-critical conditions. AETHER adds an emotional telemetry dimension to automated radio test equipment (ARTE), enabling systems to adapt, alert, and protect based on the operator’s inner state.

## 🧠 Overview

- **Emotional Telemetry Engine**: Gathers signals from cognitive, emotional, physiological, environmental, and system layers.
- **QTAP Protocol**: A simulated signal detection and triage system that classifies operator state in real-time.
- **ARTE Integration**: Maps telemetry insights to automated RF test systems for adaptive diagnostics and escalation.
- **Staged Architecture**: Modular pipelines ensure signal separation, preprocessing, classification, and triggered response.

## 🧬 Architecture Summary
Sensor Input → Ingestor → Preprocessor → Classifier → Reactor → AETHER Alert Bus

- `qtap-ingestor.py`: Accepts manual or simulated telemetry input
- `qtap-preprocessor.py`: Normalizes and formats data for analysis
- `qtap-classifier.py`: Applies decision tree logic to categorize operator state
- `qtap-reactor.py`: Determines escalation paths
- `qtap-logger.py`: Logs signals and response conditions

## 📊 Frequency Stack Model

A layered approach to interpreting signal data:

![Frequency Stack Diagram](../media/frequency_stack_diagram.png)

| Layer           | Signals                                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Physiological   | Heart rate, EEG, skin conductivity           |
| Cognitive       | Attention patterns, delay responses          |
| Emotional       | Vibration, noise levels, temperature         |
| Environmental   | RSSI, BER, test retries                      |
| System          | Bit error rate, latency, system anomalies    |

## 💡 Use Case: Automated Radio-Test Equipment (ARTE)

AETHER is now integrated with an ARTE simulation layer to demonstrate emotional-state-driven diagnostics:

- Adjusts pacing based on stress detection
- Escalates warnings if emotional state enters "critical"
- Logs performance alongside operator telemetry for future review

Phase 2 will include more complex ARTE emulation with dynamic thresholds.
