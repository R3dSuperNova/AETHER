# 📂 Toolbox Assets

This folder contains visual reference materials for tools, platforms, and sponsorship resources available during the **Bolt Hackathon (May–June 2025)**.

These assets support documentation transparency for Project AETHER, helping reviewers, collaborators, and future stakeholders understand what powers the build — and how it was resourced.
