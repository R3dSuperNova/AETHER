# 📡 Frequency Stack Overview

AETHER interfaces with multi-band signal environments to validate equipment readiness across operational domains. This document outlines the key frequency bands monitored, interpreted, and analyzed within the system.

## 🛰️ 1. Core Frequency Bands

| Band | Use Case | AETHER Role |
|------|----------|-------------|
| RF (Radio Frequency) | Tactical radios, SATCOM, mesh networks | Validates signal strength, distortion, and packet integrity |
| IR (Infrared) | Short-range line-of-sight diagnostics | Maps interference to potential environmental fatigue triggers |
| Sonar (Acoustic) | Naval & underground testing environments | Analyzes echo returns for signal loss or human input variance |

## 🧬 2. Quantum-Emulated Band *(Conceptual)*

Inspired by speculative work on frequency-less quantum tunneling patterns — this future-state module explores:

- Noise-free communication across secure tunnels
- Operator intent inferred from pattern latency shifts (experimental)

Marked for Phase III research (post-2025).

## 🔄 3. Signal Routing Model

Each signal stream is passed to:
1. **Signal Engine** → Validates fidelity
2. **Fault Model** → Cross-checks against failure signatures
3. **UI/UX Engine** → Adjusts visual tone based on degraded signal exposure (e.g., eye strain from IR)

## ✅ Future Inclusion:
- Satellite downlink harmonics (L-band, X-band)
- 5G/6G compatibility (military-secure protocols)
- Cognitive radio integrations
