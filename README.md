# 🛰️ Project AETHER  
**Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness**

---

**AETHER** is a human-aware diagnostic system that fuses **emotional telemetry** with **automated RF diagnostics** to protect and empower military operators under pressure. Built for extreme environments, AETHER interprets emotional and physiological cues—like stress, fatigue, or cognitive overload—and blends them with signal intelligence to deliver adaptive, emotionally intelligent diagnostics.

Where traditional test systems detect only technical failures, AETHER senses the warfighter.  
It’s not just a system. It’s a co-pilot.

## 🔍 Why AETHER?

In high-stakes environments like battlefield comms or aerospace diagnostics, operators encounter invisible pressures long before system failure. AETHER fills the missing link—offering an **emotional buffer**, **adaptive interface**, and **real-time escalation** based on how the operator feels, not just what the signal says.

> _“You can’t protect what you can’t feel. AETHER feels the unseen.”_

## 🧠 System Highlights

- **Emotional Telemetry Engine**  
  Detects and interprets signals from 5 layers: physiological, emotional, cognitive, environmental, and system.

- **QTAP Protocol**  
  Simulated triage logic classifies operator state (e.g., Calm, Fatigued, Stressed) and routes responses accordingly.

- **ARTE Integration**  
  Emotional telemetry triggers dynamic behavior in RF test systems—escalating based on the human, not just the hardware.

- **Staged, Modular Architecture**  
  Signal flows are processed through distinct pipeline phases: ingest → normalize → classify → react → log.

## 🧬 Architecture Overview

```text
Sensor Input → Ingestor → Preprocessor → Classifier → Reactor → AETHER Alert Bus
qtap-ingestor.py: Accepts simulated telemetry input

qtap-preprocessor.py: Normalizes data for classification

qtap-classifier.py: Maps telemetry to operator state

qtap-reactor.py: Initiates response protocols

qtap-logger.py: Records signals, responses, and state transitions

📡 Frequency Stack Framework
AETHER reads emotion and system status as layered signal intelligence.
| Layer         | Sample Signals                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Physiological | Heart rate, EEG, skin conductance         |
| Cognitive     | Response lag, attention drift             |
| Emotional     | Temperature shifts, vocal strain, tremors |
| Environmental | RSSI, test retries, BER                   |
| System        | Latency, bit errors, packet loss          |

Frequency Stack Diagram
💡 Use Case: Emotion-Aware RF Testing (ARTE)
AETHER has been integrated into an ARTE simulation to demonstrate emotional-state-driven diagnostics:

Dynamically adjusts test pacing based on stress detection

Escalates warnings if emotional state enters "critical"

Records operator state alongside signal logs for training or review

⚠️ Phase 2 will introduce real-time signal input and fatigue-adaptive UI/UX triggers.

🧭 AETHER’s Promise
In the future of warfighting, technology that sees the signal is not enough.
We need systems that see the soldier.
