# 🛰️ Project AETHER
**Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness**

---

**AETHER** is a next-generation diagnostic and emotional UX system built for high-stakes military and aerospace operations. Fusing RF signal validation with real-time emotional telemetry, AETHER redefines readiness—not just detecting faults in machines, but sensing fatigue, stress, and cognitive strain in human operators.

Where most systems alert you when it's too late, AETHER listens before the fall.

> _"You can’t protect what you can’t feel. AETHER feels the unseen."_

## 🧠 What AETHER Does

- **Reads Emotion, Reacts with Intelligence**  
  AETHER maps biometric and behavioral signals (e.g., HRV, EEG, breath rate) to emotional states like calm, fatigue, or stress, adjusting system language and logic in real-time.

- **Blends RF Diagnostics with Operator States**  
  Integrates with ARTE (Automated Radio Test Equipment) to cross-analyze telemetry with human condition—boosting accuracy, reducing false positives, and avoiding overload.

- **Adapts UI & Language Dynamically**  
  From subtle nudges to guided micro-interactions, AETHER adjusts tone, complexity, and interface based on the operator’s state.

- **Delivers Calm, Not Just Commands**  
  Whether through affirmations like "Clarity will follow" or mode shifts like "Quiet Recovery," AETHER doesn’t just react—it regulates.

## 🔧 Core Architecture

```text
Sensor Input → Ingestor → Preprocessor → Classifier → Reactor → Alert Bus
```

- `qtap-ingestor.py`: Accepts live or simulated emotional signal data
- `qtap-preprocessor.py`: Normalizes inputs for state prediction
- `qtap-classifier.py`: Classifies user state (Calm, Fatigued, Anxious, etc.)
- `qtap-reactor.py`: Triggers UX shifts and RF logic adaptations
- `qtap-logger.py`: Stores state transitions, alerts, and telemetry snapshots

## 🎛️ Adaptive UX Engine

| Emotional State      | AETHER Response                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Calm/Focused         | Clear interface, nominal microcopy: "System nominal. Ready for your command."  |
| Stressed/Anxious     | Calming tone, de-escalation: "Breathe. We're handling this together."          |
| Fatigued/Drowsy      | Activates *Vigilance Drift*: "A short break can restore peak focus."           |
| Agitated/Frustrated  | Simplifies tasks, offers choices: "Would you like a guided resolution path?"   |
| Confident/In-Control | Enables advanced visualizations and autonomy affirmations                      |

Each state shift includes sensory cues (color, haptic, sound), affirmation loops, and guided micro-interactions to restore readiness【54†aether_ux_presentation.pdf†】.

## 🚨 Tactical Modes

| Mode              | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus Lock        | Sharpens interface for high-stakes tasks                                     |
| Quiet Recovery    | Calms system visuals and language after critical strain                      |
| Vigilance Drift   | Re-engages user with sensory and micro-interaction cues                      |
| Tactical Insight  | Prioritizes diagnostic clarity during fault detection                        |
| Guardian Protocol | Emergency mode: simplifies UI, prioritizes survival and clarity              |

Mode transitions are smooth, contextual, and fully driven by integrated emotional and system telemetry【55†Research Findings for Project AETHER UX Design.pdf†】.

## 💡 Use Case: Emotion-Aware Radio Diagnostics

In simulated ARTE scenarios, AETHER:

- Detects rising operator stress mid-test and slows pacing
- Switches tone during RF anomalies: from "Fault Detected" to "Breathe. You are in control."
- Logs both technical anomalies *and* user emotional state for post-event debrief

## 🏁 Conclusion

AETHER is more than diagnostics. It's trust, felt. It's clarity under chaos. It's the emotional core modern defense systems have been missing.

In warfighting, stress isn’t optional. But suffering in silence is.

**Let AETHER listen. Let AETHER adapt. Let AETHER protect.**
