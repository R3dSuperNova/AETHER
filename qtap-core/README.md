# 📡 QTAP Diagnostics Module

QTAP (Quick Test and Analysis Protocol) is the hardware validation backbone of the AETHER system. It ensures RF signal fidelity, device readiness, and field safety before enabling emotional telemetry tracking.

This module acts as the system’s pre-flight checklist, protecting soldiers and sensitive equipment from faulty deployment or erratic behavior due to hardware faults.

## 🔍 Core Functions

- ✅ Signal path continuity testing
- ✅ Active/passive RF device checks
- ✅ Voltage and current threshold scanning
- ✅ Pre-flight modulation integrity confirmation
- ✅ Safety flag generation for field deployment
