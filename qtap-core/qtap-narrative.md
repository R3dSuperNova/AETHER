# QTAP: Quick Test and Analysis Protocol

QTAP is designed to act as a standalone, modular diagnostics suite responsible for ensuring RF path validation prior to emotional telemetry or cognitive load tracking within the AETHER platform.

## Design Motivation

Military and field-deployed equipment must be robust against physical failure, faulty signal relays, or interference. QTAP validates:

- Test lead connection integrity
- RF noise levels
- Power delivery tolerances
- Operational threshold safety

## Implementation Logic

1. Power-on self-test (POST)
2. Execute loopback and pass-through continuity tests
3. Verify modulation and interference characteristics
4. Return status to AETHER Core

### Status Codes

| Code | Meaning                        |
|------|--------------------------------|
| `0`  | PASS – All diagnostics normal  |
| `1`  | WARNING – Tolerances near edge |
| `2`  | FAIL – Abort transmission      |

---

### Future Integration

QTAP will synchronize with AETHER’s UI layer and serve as a visible “greenlight” indicator that allows real-time activation only if hardware passes all diagnostic flags.
