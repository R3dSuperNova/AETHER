# 🛰️ AETHER: Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness

> A next-gen defense system that integrates **RF diagnostics** with real-time **emotional telemetry** to protect and empower military operators in high-stress environments.

---

## ⚡ The Mission

Modern combat systems monitor everything—except the operator’s state of mind.  
AETHER is here to change that.

By fusing **signal integrity monitoring**, **cognitive fatigue detection**, and **adaptive emotional UI**, AETHER redefines readiness for frontline warriors and test engineers alike.

## 🧬 System Overview

![AETHER Logic Flow Diagram](./aether-core/media/AETHER-logic_flow_diagram.png)

AETHER is built on four interoperable modules:
- **QTAP** – Quantum Tunneling & Aetheric Pulse testing core for signal diagnostics
- **Emotionally-Aware Interface** – UI layer that adapts to cognitive load
- **Liora Companion AI** – Embedded support for emotional state reflection
- **AETHER Hub** – Centralized logging, simulation, and output engine

## 🔍 Features at a Glance

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🎯 RF Signal Simulation | Precision signal path tracking through QTAP modules |
| 💡 Real-Time Emotion Input | UI responds to user mood, stress, and alertness |
| 🧠 Companion AI | Empathic feedback via Liora agent |
| 📊 Operator Fatigue Logging | Tracks attention, tension, and task fatigue over time |
| 🛡️ Modular Deployment | Scalable for field kits, defense testing, and R&D labs |

---

## 🚀 How It Works

> Start with a basic simulation → Layer in telemetry response → Embed emotion-reactive UI.

Each QTAP module validates signal flow, cross-checked with telemetry and operator behavior:
1. Launch simulation via CLI (Python 3.13+)
2. Monitor real-time telemetry output
3. Observe UI adapt to stress, fatigue, and input lag
4. Log and evaluate behavioral output for further training or alerting
