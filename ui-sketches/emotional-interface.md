# 🧠 Emotional Interface Design – Project AETHER

The AETHER Emotional Interface is a responsive, operator-focused UI system designed to adapt in real-time based on biosignal and behavioral inputs. Its mission is to reduce cognitive load, prevent critical test errors, and create a calming, reliable interface for mission-critical testing environments.

## 🧩 1. Key UI Modes

### 🌙 Calm Mode
- **Triggered by:** sustained stress pattern, HRV drop, or frustration signature
- **Interface Behavior:**
  - Dimmed screen with soft contrast
  - Larger font size, low-saturation palette (e.g., soft blue/gray)
  - Minimal animation or flickering effects
  - Breathing rhythm guide element (optional)

---

### ⚠️ Alert Mode
- **Triggered by:** rapid task switching, signal interference, elevated urgency
- **Interface Behavior:**
  - High-contrast theme with attention-grabbing alert colors (red/yellow)
  - Clear test outcome displays with auditory notification
  - Large button prompts to reduce mis-clicks

---

### ☕ Break Mode (Micro-Recovery Prompt)
- **Triggered by:** cognitive fatigue signals or extended focus period (over 45 mins)
- **Interface Behavior:**
  - On-screen soft interruption: “Take 60 seconds to breathe”
  - Visual pulse or wave animation
  - Music or white noise loop (optional)
  - "Resume" only available after 1-minute reset

## 🧠 2. Emotion-State Input Triggers

| Input Type                 | Detection Mechanism                  | Typical UI Reaction     |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Heart Rate Variability    | Drop below baseline                  | Calm Mode                |
| Typing cadence delay      | Prolonged lag or double-back input   | Break Mode               |
| Microexpression detection | Furrowed brow, tightened lips        | Calm Mode                |
| EEG pattern spike         | High theta, low alpha sustained      | Alert Mode               |
| Environmental cue (IR)    | Brightness spike                     | Interface dims automatically |

## 🎛️ 3. UI Personalization Parameters

- Operator learning profile (updated weekly)
- Interface pacing control (speed, density)
- Alert sensitivity scale (low/med/high)
- Adaptation transparency: show or hide emotional triggers to the user

## 🧠 4. Sample Operator Flow

```plaintext
[ Start Test Session ]
        ↓
AETHER scans: HRV, input speed, face tension
        ↓
UI adapts to Calm Mode
        ↓
Test begins – signal results shown
        ↓
Operator flagged as overloaded (based on EEG proxy + input lag)
        ↓
Break Mode activates → reset timer begins
        ↓
Operator returns → UI transitions to Alert Mode (if anomaly persists)
        ↓
End of session → Human Factors log created
