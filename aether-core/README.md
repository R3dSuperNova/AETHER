# ğŸ§  AETHER Emotional Simulation â€“ Proof of Concept

This folder contains the working logic and outputs for AETHERâ€™s core emotional stress response system.

## ğŸ§ª Simulation Script

The file `emotion_logic_sim.py` allows us to simulate stress levels from `'0.0'` to `'1.0'` and outputs corresponding system behavior.

| Stress Input | System Behavior |
|--------------|------------------|
| `0.2`        | Baseline â€“ Full diagnostics enabled |
| `0.5`        | Moderate â€“ UI simplification triggered |
| `0.7`        | High â€“ Micro-break protocol triggered |
| `0.85`       | Elevated â€“ Pre-critical risk response |
| `0.95`       | Critical â€“ Testing halted for operator safety |

| Screenshot File | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| ![0.2](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.2.png) | System baseline â€“ all clear |
| ![0.5](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.5.png) | Moderate stress detected |
| ![0.7](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.7.png) | High stress â€“ auto-break engaged |
| ![0.85](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.85.png) | Elevated â€“ pre-critical |
| ![0.95](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.95.png) | Critical â€“ testing paused |

## âœ¨ Summary

This simulation validates AETHERâ€™s **foundational emotional logic engine**, where **real-time telemetry triggers adaptive operational responses**. The system can dynamically shift behavior based on operator stress input, simulating break logic, simplification, or full operational pause.

This is a critical step toward the larger mission:
