# 🧠 AETHER Emotional Simulation – Proof of Concept

This folder contains the working logic and outputs for AETHER’s core emotional stress response system.

---

## 🧪 Simulation Script

The file `emotion_logic_sim.py` allows us to simulate stress levels from `'0.0'` to `'1.0'` and outputs corresponding system behavior.

| Stress Input | System Behavior |
|--------------|------------------|
| `0.2`        | Baseline – Full diagnostics enabled |
| `0.5`        | Moderate – UI simplification triggered |
| `0.7`        | High – Micro-break protocol triggered |
| `0.85`       | Elevated – Pre-critical risk response |
| `0.95`       | Critical – Testing halted for operator safety |

## 📸 Screenshot Outputs

Each PNG below shows real terminal output from the simulation.

| Screenshot File | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| ![0.2](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.2.png) | System baseline – all clear |
| ![0.5](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.5.png) | Moderate stress detected |
| ![0.7](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.7.png) | High stress – auto-break engaged |
| ![0.85](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.85.png) | Elevated – pre-critical |
| ![0.95](media/POC%20-%20Similation%20-%200.95.png) | Critical – testing paused |

## ✨ Summary

These results demonstrate a **functioning logic layer** within AETHER, where **emotional telemetry input dynamically governs system behavior**. This is a foundational proof of concept toward the larger vision:

> “To safeguard both human and hardware integrity in high-stakes defense-grade RF testing environments through emotionally adaptive systems.”
