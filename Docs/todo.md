# Project AETHER UX Design - To-Do List

## Phase 1: Research and analyze requirements
- [x] Search for information on RF diagnostics in military applications.
- [x] Search for more specific information on RF diagnostics and fault detection in military applications.
- [x] Search for information on emotional state monitoring and UX in military contexts.
- [x] Synthesize research findings into a summary document.

## Phase 2: Design system architecture and emotional states
- [x] Define core system states for AETHER (e.g., Nominal, Alert, Critical).
- [x] Define emotional states to be monitored (e.g., Calm, Stressed, Fatigued).
- [x] Map emotional states to system responses and UI adaptations.

## Phase 3: Create adaptive interaction modes and naming conventions
- [x] Propose naming conventions for adaptive modes (e.g., Focus Lock, Quiet Recovery, Vigilance Drift).
- [x] Design micro-interactions for cognitive fatigue grounding.
- [x] Develop affirmation phrasing for signal anomalies.

## Phase 4: Develop UX language and microcopy framework
- [x] Craft UX language for technical precision (signal path diagnostics, fault detection, RF telemetry).
- [x] Craft UX language for emotional intelligence (tone adaptation, calm-state induction, decision support).
- [x] Define microcopy guidelines for system states, transitions, and user feedback.

## Phase 5: Design emotional response patterns and transitions
- [x] Detail how UI tone and language shift based on stress biomarkers.
- [x] Outline calm-state induction language when attention falters.
- [x] Specify responsive phrasing that supports decision-making under duress.
## Phase 6: Create comprehensive documentation and deliverables
- [x] Compile all UX language, interaction modes, and emotional responses into a comprehensive document.
- [x] Include examples and use cases for each design element.
- [x] Prepare a summary presentation of the AETHER UX design.
