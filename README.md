# ⚡ AETHER — Advanced Emotional Threat & Health Evaluation Radar

**Augmented Emotional Telemetry for Human-Equipment Readiness**  
*Submitted to the World’s Largest Hackathon – Hosted by Bolt & Devpost*

---

## 🧠 Overview

**AETHER** is a next-generation diagnostic system that combines RF signal analysis with real-time emotional state detection to enhance the readiness and safety of military operators in the field.

This AI-enhanced tool goes beyond error codes—detecting stress, fatigue, and cognitive degradation before they cause failure. It adapts live to the user’s emotional state and provides targeted guidance, feedback, or simplified sequences based on that condition.

> “You can’t protect what you can’t feel. AETHER feels the unseen.”

## 🔧 Features

- **Emotion-State Driven Interface**  
  Visual and interaction layers change based on operator state: Calm, Fatigued, Stressed, Critical, or Recovery.

- **Behavioral Nudging Engine**  
  Triggers prompts and UI shifts to help operators recover, simplify tasks, or hydrate when needed.

- **RF Signal & Emotional Input Fusion**  
  Designed to extend to signal validation equipment such as ARTE while factoring human degradation.

- **Dynamic UX Language**  
  Language, tone, and guidance adjust automatically based on state telemetry for clarity and focus.

- **Human-First Systems Thinking**  
  Created from field experience and empathy-centered research to assist warfighters under pressure.
